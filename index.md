I have several interests, and I like everything that could be considered “new” even if I don’t disregards the past, history and philosophy, and all that other people did in the past. 
I like politics, and I think everybody must contribute to our democracy, to keep it up and running, to shake away populism and demagogies
social life, new technology, music, cinema, arts… I like everything hides passion and bright ideas. 
I love future and I need to think about the future.. I don’t want to be dominated by fears.. of any kind. 
Humanity is not negative or positive, it is, and so it goes.
